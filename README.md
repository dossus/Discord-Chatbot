# Discord-Chatbot

Created to chat with friends from networks where the discord is blocked.
Should work on any device with python3 installed on it.
Recommend AWS EC2's remote connect option for free vm and to ssh from web browser.  Amazon linux 2 comes with python3 pre-installed.

BEFORE RUNNING -
1. CREATE Discord bot on the discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and save a copy of the bot token. 
2. ACTIVATE developer mode in discord. Right click the people who you want to talk to, copy their user IDs
3. INSERT bot token (line 9) and your friends user IDs (lines 13-21) into code.  Replace person1-4 with your friends names or whatever you want.

This is my first project.
